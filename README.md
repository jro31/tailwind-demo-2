The second repo from working through the [Tailwind YouTube demo](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5f_mz_zU5eXWYDXHUDOLBE0scnuJofO0), with commits of demos of:\
(note that there were no commits from [06: Extracting Reusable Components](https://youtu.be/v-mkUxhaFVA); this video just demo'd some basic React, but nothing Tailwind specific)

* [07: Customizing Your Design System](https://youtu.be/0l0Gx8gWPHk)
  * Running `npx tailwindcss init tailwind-full.config.js --full` to generate a `tailwind-full.config.js` file, which includes all the Tailwind styling. Then updated `postcss.config.js` to use this file (by default, the `tailwind.config.js` file is used). This means that the names/values in this file could be manually updated if you wanted to customise the Tailwind styling. - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/5fe77ce9359fae89a41d5efd959f4fcd4179f2d0)
    * This is NOT the recommended way to use custom styling (see later commits for that), but just a demo that you *can* do it this way.
  * Adding the color `brand` to the `tailwind.config.js` file, and using it in `App.jsx` - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/193605906aa96874c72ca4fc093004d7f07c4e31)
  * Also adding the `brand-light` and `brand-dark` colors, and using them in the jsx - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/4908e4c2a908b5a498cf62d12b9e84589fecc792)
  * Nesting the previously added `brand`, `brand-light` and `brand-dark` colors in within a `brand` key, including using `DEFAULT` to set the `brand` color - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/9342ca168b07c299d0d0d556c22f2f2088fdf84c)
    * Works the same as before, but is more readable
  * Importing the `Poppins` font from Google Fonts, and creating the `font-headline` class, which uses this font, and use it in `App.jsx` - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/c5e218eaa32d840227d28e7968b95b032a8618f4)
* [08: Optimizing for Production](https://youtu.be/HZn2LtBT59w)
  * Updating the `package.json` file with `"build": "vite build"`, which allows us to run the `npm run build` command. Doing this *without* updating `purge` in `tailwind.config.js` would generate ALL Tailwind CSS classes, and make a huge CSS file in the production build. However, in this commit we also update `purge` to `purge: ['./src/**/*.jsx', './index.html']`, which tells `purge` which files to look for classes in, allowing it to keep only the necessary CSS. - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/916faf980b197d0ad845175d901d3aca30c866d1)
    * The files generated by `npm run build` are stored in the `dist` folder
  * Giving a demo of how `purge` only looks for exact class name text strings within the given files, and how it doesn't recognise dynamically generated classes - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/001b1768749f024a37165ca3866eece02e861d59)
    * For example, given `const size = 32` and ``className={`h-${size}`}``, `purge` would **not** include the `h-32` class because it *didn't* find an `h-32` string
    * However, having `<p>h-32</p>`, the `h-32` class *would* be included in the CSS build, because it *did* find a specific `h-32` string, even though it wasn't as a CSS class
  * An example of how you could ensure that you include full class names, while still generating the classes dynamically - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/2a6ee83f2800d523bccd8300cf6dd710eb2ec3e7)
  * Updating `purge` to be an object in order to add the extra values `enabled` and `options` - [Commit link](https://github.com/jro31/tailwind-demo-2/commit/66683a6b599937c2b9ce12edece2f37df3ca91ac)
    * A pretty useless commit, but an example of the syntax
